## Overview

Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud provides an easy-to-use, fully autonomous database that scales elastically, delivers fast query performance and requires no database administration. In this hands on lab, we will walk through deploying an Autonomous Data Warehouse database and loading a table using a text file that is stored in object storage. The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse primitives. At the end of this lab, you will be familiar with launching an Autonomous Data Warehouse database, creating an object storage bucket and loading a table using a text file stored in object storage.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account credentials (User, Password, and Tenant) with available service limit for Autonomous Data Warehouse
- SQL Developer tool
- A simple text editor like Notepad, vi or Sublime.

## Practice 1: Download channel text file and install SQL Developer Tool

**1.** Open the txt file from this link: https://bit.ly/3jRIdd0.

**2.** Right click on the file and save it on your desktop.

> **Note:**  This file will be loaded into Object Storage and later used to load data into the CHANNELS table.

**3.** Download SQL Developer Tool from this link: [https://tinyurl.com/u7haa4ql](https://tinyurl.com/u7haa4ql) and install on your local computer.

## Practice 2: Sign in to OCI Console

**1.** Open a supported browser and go to the Console URL. https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/

**2.** Enter your tenant name: **emeaccoe** and click **Next**

**3.** Enter your user name and password and click on **Sign In**


When you sign in to the Console, the home page is displayed.

The home page gives you quick links to the documentation and to Oracle Support.

## Practice 4: Download a Connection Wallet for ADW Database

Oracle connection wallet are downloaded from the Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud administrative service console by a service administrator. If you are not an Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud administrator, your administrator should provide you with the client credentials. Wallet files, along with the Database user ID and password provide access to data in your Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud.

**1.** On the details page of your ADW, click on **Service Console**
 
 ![]( img/ADWTEST2.png)

**2.** On the left side of the page click on **Administration**

**3.** Click on **Download a Connection Wallet** 

![]( img/ADWTEST3.png)

**4.** You must protect this file to prevent unauthorized database access. Therefore, you need to create a password to protect this file. For this exercise enter the same password you used on Practice-3 *OracleAxt8Qr* and click **Download** and save it to your *Downloads* folder

## Practice 5: Create a bucket in Object Storage and upload the text file

For the fastest data loading experience Oracle recommends uploading the source files to a cloud-based object store, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, before loading the data into your Autonomous DW Cloud. 
To load data from files in the cloud into your Autonomous DW Cloud database, use the new PL/SQL DBMS_CLOUD package. The DBMS_CLOUD package supports loading data files from the following Cloud sources: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage Classic, and Amazon AWS S3. Lets create an Object Storage Bucket inside of you working Compartment.

**1.** On OCI Dashboard **Menu** click on **Object Storage** > **Object Storage**

**2.** Make sure to select your working Compartment

**3.** Click on **Create Bucket** and enter the following information:

- **Bucket Name**: ADW_Bucket
- **Storage Tier**: Standard
	
**4.** Click **Create Bucket** 

**5.** Click on **Edit Visibility** and choose **Public**

**6.** Click on the *ADW_Bucket* link to see its details page.

**7.** Upload the century_names_new.txt file to the *ADW_Bucket*


## Practice 6: Creating an Auth token for OCI user
An Auth token is an Oracle-generated token that you can use to authenticate with third-party APIs. For example, use an auth token to authenticate with a Swift client when using Recovery Manager (RMAN) to back up an Oracle Database System (DB System) database to Object Storage. Lets start the process of creating an Auth token:

**1.** On the top right corner click on the User Profile icn and ten sect the *User Settings* menu item.

![]( img/usericon.png)

**3.** On the left side of page under **Resources**,  click on **Auth Tokens** and then click **Generate Token**
![]( img/authToken1.png)

**4.** Enter the following Description: *Auth Token for ADW Database* and click the *Generate Token* button.

**5.** Copy the generated token and **save** it in a notepad/text file. You will use it to create the database credential. *A portion of the generated token has been hidden for security reasons.*
![]( img/authToken2.png)

## Practice 7: Login to the ADW database and store the object store credentials
In this portion of the lab you will use SQL Developer to create a connection to the Autonomous Data Warehouse database you created earlier. You will use the admin user credentials for this part.
Once you connect to the admin user, you will create a ocitest user (a demo user), grant it the DWROLE role and then create a SQL Developer connection using the ocitest user credentials.
The ocitest user will be the owner of the CHANNELS table that will be used for loading data.

**1.** Launch SQL Developer on your laptop and click on **+** to create a new connection
![]( img/image020.png)

**2.** Create a new connection using the following values:

- **Connection Name**: ADWTEST
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: *OracleAxt8Qr*
- **Connection Type**: Cloud Wallet
- **Configuration File**: *Browse to the wallet zip file collected from Practice-4* 
- **Service**: adwtest_medium

![]( img/createConn1.png)

**3.** Click on **Save** then click **Connect**

**4.** You are now connected to ADW.
![]( img/sqlDev1.png)

**5.** Now that you have logged into SQL Developer, execute the following statements to create the **ocitest** user and to grant **DWROLE** to this user:

```
create user ocitest identified by "OracleAxt8Qr";
grant dwrole to ocitest;
grant unlimited tablespace to ocitest;
GRANT CREATE SESSION to ocitest;
```
Execute the script by pressing the *Execute Script* button.
![]( img/sqlDev2.png)

**6.**  Now lets create a new SQL connection using the following values:

- **Connection Name**: ADWTEST-OCITEST
- **Username**: ocitest
- **Password**: *OracleAxt8Qr*
- **Connection Type**: Cloud Wallet
- **Configuration File**: *Browse to the wallet zip file collected from Practice-4* 
- **Service**: adwtest_medium

**7.** Click on **Save** then click **Connect**

![]( img/createConn2.png)
> **Note:** You may be prompted to enter your ocitest user password:
![]( img/conn2pw.png)

**8.** Once connected, you will store your object credentials using the procedure **DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL** running the following SQL Statement:
 
> **Note:**  
> The username is your oci "username" that you used to log into the OCI web console.
> Replace "password" with the generated token you copied from Practice-6.

```
begin
 DBMS_CLOUD.create_credential (
     credential_name => 'OBJ_STORE_CRED',
     username => '<userXX>',
     password => '<your Auth Token>'  
  ) ;
end;
```

![]( img/createCredential1.png)

You should see an output of “PL/SQL Procedure successfully completed.” if there are no execution errors or typos in the script.

## Practice 8: Load data into ADW using channels text file

In this portion of the lab you will use SQL Developer to create the CHANNELS table in the ocitest schema. Once the table is created, you will load it with data from the channels.txt file stored in the object storage.

**1.** Launch SQL Developer on your laptop and connect to the ocitest user.

**2.** Execute the following SQL script:

```
CREATE TABLE CHANNELS (

NAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL ,

gender VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL ,

NAME_total NUMBER NOT NULL );
```

You should see an output of **Table CHANNELS created** if there are no execution errors or typos in the script.


**3.** Now lets load data into the CHANNELS table using the channels.txt file. The first thing you will need is a file URI to the *channels.txt* object you created earlier. To find this, use a text editor and create the URI using the following format:
> https://swiftobjectstorage.**your region**.oraclecloud.com/v1/**your object namespace**/**your bucket name**/century_names_new.txt

For example:
> https://swiftobjectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/v1/frxplqvlwvmz/ADW_Bucket/century_names_new.txt

**4.** Back in SQL Developer, in the ADWTEST-OCITEST connction page copy and paste in the command shown below. Be sure to substitue your URL where shown.

``` 
begin

dbms_cloud.copy_data(

table_name =>'CHANNELS',

credential_name =>'OBJ_STORE_CRED',

file_uri_list =>'<your URI>',format => json_object('delimiter' value ',', 'trimspaces' value 'lrtrim')

);

end;
```
Press the **Run Script** buton when ready.

**4.** Still using the SQL Developer tool, perform the following SQL query:

```
select * from channels;
order by name_total desc;
```

You have successfully imported the century_names_new.txt file from your on-premises to ADW!
